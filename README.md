# OrderedArrayList

group discussion on 12.09.2020

we didn't talk much but we reminded ourselves to throw an illegalargumentexception for null values and
we'd override the add (one at an index and one at the end of a list)

for sorting it, we'd compare two at a time and keep swapping values (maybe.. this should be attempted and tested)
